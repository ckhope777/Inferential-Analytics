# Inferential-Analytics
A comprehensive project applying Inferential Statistics to real-world datasets to solve business and operational problems. Includes analysis on nuclear power plant accident risks, exam grade distributions, and the effectiveness of a new landing pageâ€”aimed at generating actionable insights for data-driven decision-making.

**Leveraging inferential statistics to turn data into actionable business insights.**

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of inferential statistics to real-world datasets to solve business and operational problems. The goal is to provide actionable insights that enable data-driven decision-making and improve performance, risk management, and user engagement.

Three key case studies are included:

1. **Nuclear Power Plant Accident Risk Assessment**  
   Evaluate the probability and potential impact of accidents to help improve safety protocols and risk mitigation strategies.

2. **Exam Grades Distribution Analysis**  
   Analyze student exam scores to assess performance trends, grading criteria, and overall academic effectiveness.

3. **Landing Page Effectiveness Analysis**  
   Measure the performance of a new landing page to identify opportunities for optimization and higher user engagement.

## Objectives
- Apply inferential statistical techniques to derive meaningful insights from datasets.  
- Solve real-world business and operational problems using data.  
- Present insights in a clear and actionable manner to support decision-making.  

## Datasets
- **Nuclear Power Plant Dataset:** Contains historical accident data, operational metrics, and risk factors.  
- **Exam Grades Dataset:** Includes anonymized student scores across different subjects and exams.  
- **Landing Page Dataset:** User interaction metrics, conversion rates, and engagement statistics.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.  
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary measures, visualizations, and initial trend analysis.  
- **Inferential Statistics:** Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, ANOVA, and correlation analysis.  
- **Insights & Recommendations:** Actionable conclusions based on statistical analysis.

## Key Insights
- Assessed accident risk probabilities and identified high-risk scenarios for nuclear operations.  
- Highlighted performance gaps and grading trends in exam datasets.  
- Evaluated landing page effectiveness and recommended design and content improvements to boost engagement.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- Optional: PowerPoint/Markdown for reporting insights
